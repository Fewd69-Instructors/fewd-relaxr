###Evaluation / Submission

Students will create a new repository on GitHub called "homework-landingpage" and push their code to it when they are ready to submit. Instructional team should evaluate against the solution code and the student's use of technical elements. They will provide a numeric grade on a scale: does not meet expectations (0); meets expectations (1); exceeds expectations (2). Bonus sections are completely optional. The maximum possible score on this assignment is 14/14.
